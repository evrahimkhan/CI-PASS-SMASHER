# Sample Protected Document

This is a sample document that would normally be password protected.

## Purpose

This file serves as an example of a document that might need password recovery. In a real scenario, this would be an actual password-protected file of one of these types:

- Microsoft Office document (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx)
- PDF file (.pdf) 
- Archive file (.zip, .rar)
- Or any other supported format

## Testing

When using the John the Ripper GitHub Action, you would specify the path to your actual protected file in the workflow parameters.

## Security Notice

This project is intended for authorized penetration testing and security research only. Always ensure you have explicit permission before attempting to recover passwords from any system or file you do not own.
